# My enthusiasm lies in exploring how VR and AI-mediated technologies can influence an individual‚Äôs perception and behavior, and the potential of this influence to enhance communication among people. 
# For my thesis, I developed a VR system named *LegacySphere*. The system offers a perspective-taking approach aimed at enhancing younger adults' understanding and empathy towards their elder family members by allowing them to experience their family members' viewpoints.

My research focuses on **Computer Mediated Communication (CMC)**, particularly on how alterations in **voice and visual** presentation influence self-perception and perceptions of others. My work leverages **AI and VR technologies** and spans  various CMC scenarios, including **intergenerational communication, gaming, and online dating**. <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><b>Two of my papers, for which I was the first author, received Honorable Mention Awards at CHI 2024 and CHI 2021 üèÜ.</b> </FONT> 


I am starting my PhD studies in Computer Science at the **University of Toronto**, where I‚Äôll be working with **Prof. [Daniel Wigdor](https://danielwigdor.com/)** 

Prior to this, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at the **University of British Columbia**, under the co-supervision of **Prof. [Joanna McGrenere](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~joanna/)** and **Prof. [Dongwook Yoon](https://dwyoon.com/)**.
